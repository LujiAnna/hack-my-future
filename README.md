# [Hack My Future](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/curriculum)

> A repository to organize my studying notes [modules](https://hackyourfuture.be/class-9-10/) in [class 9-10 at HYF](https://github.com/LujiAnna/class-9-10) and study board.
> Table of contents for all of the exercises and projects you push to GitHub. 
> Keeping a tidy, organized list of all my work will be helpful for review and a good starting point for my [portfolio](https://github.com/LujiAnna/LujiAnna.github.io).
> [GitHub is your resume!](https://anti-pattern.com/github-is-your-resume-now), [another article](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2015/11/13/how-to-make-github-as-your-new-resume/)

> 1. Fork this repository and pin it to your github account.
> 1. Clone it into the top level of wherever you store your notes and projects and set it up for organized note taking ...
>    - ... by topic. Maybe you like to take your notes by subject, with a folder for all of your notes on JavaScript, one for Git, one for the debugger.
>    - ... by module. Perhaps you like to organize your notes with one folder per module, keeping track of what you have learned in the order you learned it.
>    - ... by project. Or do you like to organize the skills you learn by the project you were working on when you learned them.
> 1. Continue experimenting as you study, finding how this repository can best help you organize your learning. To reorganize it as time goes on, and to make whatever project boards, folders, issues or pull requests you find helpful.
