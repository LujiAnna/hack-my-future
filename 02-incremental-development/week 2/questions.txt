Question: ...

Folder path: HYF/02-incremental-development/week\ 2

1. I did git clone to the team-workflow Repo  `git clone https://github.com/gelilaa/team-workflow.git`
Note: on my folder directory on the left : I can't see the repo on my folder tree

2. Listing to see if repo is there  `ls`
Note: team-workflow repo is listed on bash, BUT I still cant see it on the left folder tree

3. I moved into the repo  `cd team-workflow\` and `ls`
Note: Everyfile is listed from the repo 

open index.html // this one ran it on browser
open -a "visual studio code" index.html // this one did the magic and opened a new vsc window having the index.html
open -a "visual studio code" CSS/style.css //this opened a style.css file which was inside folder CSS
mkdir img // create img folder
cp -R ../../../week\ 1/acme-web-design/img/* .  //copy folder with images from another image folder to the current image folder am in
ls -l img/  //check whats inside the folder 
I had to also $cd img and $cd .. (to move in and out of the directory)
