Q1: On this week (2. Incremental Development) Exercise 1:  html-css-git-exercises: week-2 repo 

 https://github.com/LujiAnna/html-css-git-exercises/tree/master/week-2

 Am trying to do exercise 18-git-merge 
  I did 
  $ git checkout -b orange_links
  When I was on that branch, I changed the links to orange
  I also did 
  $ git commit -am 'orangered links'
  Then this
  $ git push -u origin orange_links
  My problem is : I do not see the yellow bar .
  I see this instead on the picture 
  What could the problem be ?

  Q2 : When am in new branch and do `$ git merge master`, I get the below message.
  I do not understand it or what to do with it or how to proceeed or 
  which commands to use , so i quit using `:qa` . Nothing is still merged yet, as the master branch is still not up to per with my local changes

  Should I merge from master, and merge branch from there, or what should I do?
 ` 
Merge branch 'master' into navigation
# Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
# especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.
#
# Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts
# the commit.
